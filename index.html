        <h2>Summary</h2>
    
        <p><em>The Nightmare Before Christmas</em>, often promoted as <em>Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas</em>, is a 1993 American stop motion musical fantasy film directed by Henry Selick and produced/co-written by Tim Burton. It tells the story of Jack Skellington, a being from <em>Halloween Town</em> who opens a portal to <em>Christmas Town</em> and decides to celebrate the holiday, with some dastardly and comical consequences.</p>
    
        <p><em>The Nightmare Before Christmas</em> originated in a poem written by Tim Burton in 1982, while he was working as a Disney animator. With the success of <em>Vincent</em> in the same year, Disney started to consider developing <em>The Nightmare Before Christmas</em> as either a short film or 30-minute television special. Over the years, Burton's thoughts regularly returned to the project, and in 1990, he made a development deal with Disney. Production started in July 1991 in San Francisco. Disney decided to release the film under their Touchstone Pictures banner because they thought the movie would be "too dark, and scary for kids."</p>

        <p>The filmmakers constructed 227 puppets to represent the characters in the movie, with Jack Skellington having around four hundred heads, allowing the expression of every possible emotion. Sally's mouth movements “were animated through the replacement method. During the animation process, [...] only Sally's face mask was removed in order to preserve the order of her long, red hair. Sally had ten types of faces, each made with a series of eleven expressions (e.g. eyes open and closed, and various facial poses) and synchronised mouth movements.”</p>
        
        <p>The stop motion figurine of Jack Skellington was reused in <em>James and the Giant Peach</em> (also directed by Selick) as a dead pirate captain.</p>
